 * 
 * Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group 
 * of objects in similar way as a single object. Composite 
 * pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to 
 * represent part as well as whole hierarchy. This type of 
 * design pattern comes under structural pattern as this 
 * pattern creates a tree structure of group of objects.
 * 
 * This pattern creates a class that contains group of its 
 * own objects. This class provides ways to modify its group 
 * of same objects.
 * 
 * We are demonstrating use of composite pattern via following 
 * example in which we will show employees hierarchy of an 
 * organisation.
